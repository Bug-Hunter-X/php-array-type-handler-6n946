This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in PHP related to data type handling within a recursive array processing function. The `bug.php` file shows the function encountering an unexpected data type (integer) which results in the function skipping the integer and continuing to process the rest of the array. The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates how to handle this potential error by using type checking in a more robust way.
